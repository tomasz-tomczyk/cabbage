defmodule Mix.Tasks.Conformance.Cck do
  @shortdoc "Grades the message-emitting runner against the Cucumber Compatibility Kit"

  @moduledoc """
  Runs the message-emitting runner (`Cabbage.Messages`) over the vendored Cucumber
  Compatibility Kit samples and prints a scoreboard, e.g.

      CCK: 15/44

  For each *targeted* sample it parses the `.feature`, runs the Elixir step definitions,
  normalizes both the produced and golden envelope streams, and compares them. Deferred
  CCK areas (hooks, attachments, parameter-types, retry, ...) are listed as `unsupported`
  so they neither pass nor crash the run.

  Pass `--verbose` to print the first diverging envelope for each failing sample.

  Must run in `:test` (the vendored corpus + harness live under `test/`); `def cli/0` in
  `mix.exs` declares the preferred env so plain `mix conformance.cck` works.
