# T3: a step's gherkin table and doc string are reachable from the context map
# under the reserved keys `:__table__` / `:__doc_string__`. This is the uniform
# path that also works for cucumber-expression (string-pattern) steps, whose
# matched data is a positional list with no room for named `:table`/`:doc_string`.
# The reserved keys are injected per step (each step sees its OWN gherkin data)
# and must NOT be threaded forward: a `:ok`/`nil`/`{:ok, _}` return strips them so
# they cannot accumulate or appear in a later step's threaded-state destructure.
