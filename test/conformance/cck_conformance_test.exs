  Drives the message-emitting runner (`Cabbage.Messages`) over the vendored Cucumber
  Compatibility Kit samples and asserts each targeted area's normalized envelope stream
  equals its golden.

  Tagged `:conformance` so it is excluded from the default `mix test` run (which must stay
  green). Run with `mix conformance` or `mix test --only conformance`. The plain scoreboard
  is `mix conformance.cck`.
